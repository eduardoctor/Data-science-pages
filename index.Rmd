This repository is meant to include various tutorials on how to use different packages mainly as personal notes to navigate data science to perform a variety of statistical analysis. However, feel free to use anything that you may find helpful.

The main topics discussed here are: 

* [Python ![Python](images/python_logo.png)](https://python.org) 
* [Google colab ![google colab](images/colab_logo.png)](https://colab.research.google.com)
* [R studio ![R](images/Rlogo.png)](https://rstudio.com)
* [STATA](https://stata.com) (ocassionally)

You can see other notes, resources and links that do contain little to no code in my [wiki](https://github.com/eduardorod1229/Notes-and-tutorials/wiki).
